All Phar archives contain three to four sections:
    1.a stub
    2.a manifest describing the contents
    3.the file contents
    4.[optional] a signature for verifying Phar integrity (phar file format only)

Usage:

php coolapplication.phar
    Phar archives are similar in concept to Java JAR archives, but are tailored to the needs and to the flexibility of
    PHP applications. A Phar archive is used to distribute a complete PHP application or library in a single file. A Phar
    archive application is used exactly like any other PHP application:

include 'coollibrary.phar';
    Using a Phar archive library is identical to using any other PHP library.

file_get_contents('phar:///fullpath/to/coollibrary.phar/images/wow.jpg');
    The phar stream wrapper allows accessing the files within a phar archive using PHP's standard file functions fopen(),
    opendir(), and others that work on regular files. The phar stream wrapper supports all read/write operations on
    both files and directories.

$p = new Phar('coollibrary.phar', 0);
    The Phar class implements advanced functionality for accessing files and for creating phar archives

Class:

The Phar class supports reading/creating and manipulation of Phar archives
The PharData class extends the Phar, and allows creating and modifying non-executable (data) tar
    and zip archives
